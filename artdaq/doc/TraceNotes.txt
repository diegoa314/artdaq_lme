An idea: would it be useful to assign ranges of TRACE levels to different
classes or functions inside artdaq?

If so, here is an initial proposal:
- level 0: errors
- levels  1- 3: available
- levels  4- 7: RHandles
- levels  8-11: SHandles
- levels 12-15: EventStore
- levels 16-23: BoardReaderCore, EventBuilderCore, AggregatorCore
- levels 24-27: Generators
- levels 28-31: main routines
- levels 32-63: available


To enable tracing, run "export TRACE_NAME=artdaq" and "tlvlM -nartdaq -1"
before starting the MPI program. Then use "tshow" to show the contents of
the trace buffer, and "ttids" to show the list of names.
